# ddf (Dashboard Design Framework)
ddf is a free to use HTML/CSS framework that you can use inside your wp-admin dashboard.
It has basic styling, elements and columns taken care of, so for every new plugin/theme that you create you do not have to create a dashboard design.

If you want to update anything, please make a Pull request and do not directly push to master.
